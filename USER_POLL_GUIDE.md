## üìä How Poll Results Work

### Weighted Voting System
Your vote doesn't just count as "1 vote" - it's weighted based on your XP level:

**Example:**
- 5 people vote for Peace (average 3x power each) = 15 weighted votes
- 3 people vote for Voting (average 3x power each) = 9 weighted votes  
- 2 people vote for Disaster (average 2x power each) = 4 weighted votes
- **Peace wins** with 15 weighted votes!

### Fund Allocation
The $1M is distributed proportionally based on weighted votes:
- **Peace**: 53.6% = $536,000
- **Voting**: 32.1% = $321,000
- **Disaster**: 14.3% = $143,000
